The **Brick Breaker Game** is a simple yet engaging arcade game built using **C++ and SFML**, where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game features smooth paddle and ball movement, realistic collision detection with walls and bricks, and a simple game-over condition when the ball falls below the paddle. Players can use the **left (‚Üê) and right (‚Üí) arrow keys** to move the paddle and aim to clear all the bricks to win. To install and run the game, ensure **SFML** is installed on your system, then compile the code using `g++ brick_breaker.cpp -o brick_breaker -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system` and run `./brick_breaker`. The game is open for contributions, and users can report issues or suggest improvements via GitHub. To publish the project, initialize a Git repository using `git init`, add the files, commit with a message, and push it to a newly created repository on GitHub. This game serves as a fun introduction to game development using **C++ and SFML**, making it a great project for beginners and enthusiasts alike. üöÄ
